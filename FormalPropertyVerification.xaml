                    <Run Text=": Is the process of verifying properties usually expressed as assertions or cover points on an RTL model. However it is fundamentally different from design verification simulations. The inputs to the process includes : * An RTL model, * A set of properties to prove: assertions &amp; cover points * A set of constraints: assumptions, plus clock and reset definitions.  Unlike simulations it does not check a specific signal value, all possible achievable values under the current constraints are checked at once:  Hence the output of the process is a proven property list (proven assertions and unreachable cover points - i.e beyond the scope of the current verification environment) , bounded proof ( for each disproved assertion or reachable cover point a waveform showing a case of failure / reach ability and a list of bounded or inconclusive proofs: asserts and covers that were not definitely proven or disproven. For all modern FPV tools, the RTL models used in FPV must be synthesizable however popular simulation based validation methodologies like Open Verification Methodology (OVM) and Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) can be separated from the synthesizable models by using the bind construct in System Verilog.  Hence with proper planning one can keep the synthesizable code separate from non-synthesizable code to enable FPV.  Steps to bringing up a FPV include:  "/>
